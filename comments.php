    <h1>PHP Commenting</h1>
    <?php
        /* Comments are be used to:
            1. Let other understand your code
            2. Remind yourself of what you did
            3. Leave out some parts of your code

            Example:

        Syntax for comments in PHP code:
            // This is a single-line comment
            # This is also a single-line comment

            /* This is a 
            multi-line comment */
         
        // outputs a welcome message;
        echo "Welcome home!";
        
        echo "This is my first code"; #comment at the end of a line;

        // Comments to Ignore Code
        // echo "Happy coding!";
    ?>;
